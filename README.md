# 🛍️ Interactive Product Explorer

This is my submission for the **Frontend Developer Internship Assignment** at **Razorpod**.  
The project is a responsive **Product Showcase Explorer** built with **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion**.  

It fetches data from the **DummyJSON API** and allows users to browse, filter, sort, and view detailed product information with smooth animations.
